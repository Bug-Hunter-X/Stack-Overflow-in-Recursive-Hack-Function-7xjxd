# Stack Overflow in Recursive Hack Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions written in Hack: exceeding the maximum recursion depth and causing a stack overflow.

The `bug.hack` file contains a recursive factorial function that works correctly for small inputs but fails for larger ones due to exceeding the recursion depth limit. The `bugSolution.hack` file provides a corrected iterative version.
